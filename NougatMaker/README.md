# NougatMaker

**Important:** This library does not *make* nougat. It is a simple .NET class library that provides access to a single, perfect (debatable) AI-generated image of a nougat.

## What It Does

This package contains one embedded resource: an image of nougat created using DALL-E 3 (via ChatGPT). The primary purpose of this library is to serve as a simple, lightweight package for testing CI/CD pipelines without interfering with actual real KS-FIKS projects.

## Usage

To access the nougat image, you can use the `GetResourceStream` method.

```csharp
using NougatMaker;

Stream? imageStream = Class1.GetResourceStream("Nougat.jpg");
```

## License
